NHaml
==============
NHaml (pronounced enamel) is a pure .NET implementation of the popular Rails
Haml view engine. From the Haml website:

"Haml is a markup language that‘s used to cleanly and simply describe the XHTML
of any web document, without the use of inline code. Haml functions as a
replacement for inline page templating systems such as PHP, ERB, and ASP.
However, Haml avoids the need for explicitly coding XHTML into the template,
because it is actually an abstract description of the XHTML, with some code
to generate dynamic content." 

In other words, NHaml is an external DSL for XML. It’s primary qualities are it’s
simplicity, terseness, performance and that it outputs nicely formatted XML.
Additionally, the NHaml view engine provides support for Rails style layouts and
partials and ships with an ASP.NET MVC view engine.
